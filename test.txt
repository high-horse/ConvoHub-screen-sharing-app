If you've updated your GitHub username and aren't receiving errors but still notice that the old username appears when interacting with repositories, there are several places and settings to verify:
1. Check Remote URLs

When cloning a new repository or interacting with an existing one, ensure that the remote URL is correct:

    Verify Remote URL for New Repositories:
    After cloning a new repository, navigate into the repository directory and check the remote URL:

    bash

cd path/to/new-repository
git remote -v

The URL should reflect your new GitHub username:

perl

origin  https://github.com/new-username/repo-name.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/new-username/repo-name.git (push)

If it still shows the old username, update it as follows:

bash

    git remote set-url origin https://github.com/new-username/repo-name.git

2. Check Local Git Configuration

Sometimes, Git's local configuration may still have references to your old username:

    Check Local Configurations:

    bash

git config --list --local

Look for any entries related to user.name or user.email. Update them if necessary:

bash

git config --local user.name "New Username"
git config --local user.email "your-email@example.com"

Check Global Configurations:

bash

git config --list --global

Ensure user.name and user.email are up to date:

bash

    git config --global user.name "high-horse"
    git config --global user.email "akhileshadhikaria1@gmail.com"

3. Clear Git Credential Cache

If your Git credentials are cached, they may still be using the old username. Clear your credentials cache:

    For macOS Keychain:
        Open Keychain Access.
        Search for GitHub-related entries.
        Delete any old or incorrect entries.

    For Windows Credential Manager:
        Open Credential Manager from the Control Panel.
        Locate and remove any GitHub-related credentials.

    For Linux Credential Helper:
    If you're using git-credential-store, clear the credentials:

    bash

    git credential-cache exit

4. Update GitHub SSH Key (if applicable)

If you use SSH keys for authentication, ensure your SSH key is correctly associated with your new GitHub account:

    Check SSH Keys:

    bash

ssh-add -l

Ensure the key listed is associated with your new GitHub account.

Update SSH Config File (if applicable):
Edit ~/.ssh/config to make sure it reflects the correct GitHub hostname and identity file.

bash

    Host github.com
      User git
      Hostname github.com
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

5. Verify GitHub Repository Access

Make sure you have access to repositories under your new username:

    Create a Test Repository:
    Create a new repository under your new username on GitHub and clone it to verify that the username is correctly reflected.

    Push Changes:
    Try pushing changes to verify that there are no authentication issues.

6. Check for Old Username in Commit History

If the old username appears in commit history, it might be due to commits made before the username change. This is normal and won’t affect future commits:

    Check Commit Author:

    bash

    git log --pretty=format:'%an <%ae>'

    This shows the author name and email in commit history. If it still shows the old username, it’s likely because those commits were made before the change.

By following these steps, you should be able to ensure that your Git configuration, credentials, and repository URLs are updated to reflect your new GitHub username. If there are no errors but you're still seeing issues, it's often related to cached credentials or outdated remote URLs.
